PHP-Growl is an implementation of the [Growl notification system](http://growl.info) written in PHP.

As a proof of concept example, I've written a [Mint](http://haveamint.com) [Pepper](http://haveamint.com/peppermill/) plugin that notifies you whenever certain events (like new referrals, unique visitors, etc) happen on your website. It's a slick way to stay on top of who is visiting your site. You can [download Growl Pepper here](http://www.haveamint.com/peppermill/pepper/49/growl/).
